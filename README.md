# Mapping_Earthquakes
Basil and Sadhana like how I created the earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

 The codes in GitHub folder (Earthquake Challenge) in Mapping Earthquakes repository provides two index.html files as follows:

 index1.html is for Deliverable 1 and index 2.html helps in creating relevant maps which meet the requirements for Deliverables 2 and 3.

 It is hoped this will meet the expectations of Basil and Sadhana.
 
 # Revised major_eq_starter_logic.js
 
 This code is revised after incorporating the comments received from the Grader on the first submission. Now one can see "Major Earthquakes" marker is incorporated and so also Dark layer.
